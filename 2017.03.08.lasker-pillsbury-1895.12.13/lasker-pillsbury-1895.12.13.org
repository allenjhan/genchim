* Again, what if 14.Qxb7
** On low depth, the engine is saying that white should play Qxb7 and keep equality. It feels very engine-like, this move. The justification is that, having played Bf4, white can take on c7. But with an open kingside, this feels like a very risky move from white, and most people would not play it. If white does play it, black should use it as an invitation to attack

** after 15.Bg3, 15...f4 isn't even the engine's strongest reply; the idea is that black wants to make the resource 16...Nf4+ work, so he plays 15...Bd6, and if white takes on f5 now, then black wins the queen with -2.6

** still, it's not clear how black should respond if 15.Bg3, although the human move would be to push on f4; so let's look at 15.Bg3 f4; white apparently has play against the black king after Bf5; there are two possibilities then, either black takes on d4 with the knight, or plays Ncd8; let us assume Ncxd4,
